# samplekmeans

The goal of `samplekmeans` is to facilitate data sampling with the
k-means algorithm. Spatial data are the main focus, but other data types
should be covered eventually.

The package is work in progress.

## Installation

Make sure the devtools package is installed first:

``` r
install.packages('devtools')

library(devtools)

install_github("anbm-dk/samplekmeans")
```
